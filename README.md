        1. read words from a file and store them into a dynamic array
        2. print the words in the text file one word per line, using the dynamic array
        3. count how many words start with each letter of the alphabet
        4. print out the letters of the alphabet and the number of words in the textfile beginning with that letter
        5. organise the words alphabetically in a 3d array
        6. free the 3d array
        7. print the words alphabetically under their associated letter
